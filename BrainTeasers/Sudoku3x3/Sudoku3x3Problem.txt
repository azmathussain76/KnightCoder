Put 1-9 into 3x3 matrix, and have the same sum in every rows and columns and two diagonal.

Solution: as I've solved it on 20180916
Row-wise:
2 7 6
9 5 1
4 3 8

Can iterate through the list of 1-9 to find the matching pairs,
with two iteration variables, i and j, starting on opposite ends
of the array.

compute each pair until reaching the middle, which is by itself--5

Therefore 5 must be part of every combination, with the total of each
row, column and diagonal equal to 15

We can lay out the values in 5 steps
1. Put 5 in the middle
2. Put the most-skewed (using differencing) pair first
3. Place the next most-skewed pair so it doesn't overlap the first--go to a diagonal
4. Can now place the rest using the differences found from the rows and
colums with only 1 element unfilled
