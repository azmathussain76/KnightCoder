algorithm to find route to a ball for a robot in a maze.

Can do this recursively, by examining every path, traversing it recursively until you either find a wall, or the ball.

The recursion tree gets very deep for this, but at least the robot can find the ball first before making the first move and
without using any kind of backtracking.

The return value will be a list of directions (steps and turns) for the robot to use to find the ball.
